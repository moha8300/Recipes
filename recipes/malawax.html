    <p>Malawax are thin, lacy Somali crepes often enjoyed for breakfast or as a snack. Theyâ€™re slightly sweet, with
        hints of cardamom and nutmeg, and are served with butter, honey, or sugar.</p>

        <li>Oil or butter for frying</li>

    </ul>

        <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat and lightly grease with oil or butter.</li>
        <li>Pour a ladleful of batter into the pan, swirling to coat the surface evenly.</li>
