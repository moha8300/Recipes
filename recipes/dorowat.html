    <p>Doro Wat is a flavorful and spicy Ethiopian chicken stew made with a base of slow-cooked onions, spiced clarified
        butter, and berbere spice mix. Itâ€™s traditionally served with injera, a spongy flatbread.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>1 kg chicken (legs or thighs, skin removed)</li>
        <li>3 large onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp berbere spice mix</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>

        <li>2 boiled eggs (optional, peeled)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, cook the chopped onions over low heat, stirring frequently, until soft and golden (no oil
            needed initially).</li>
        <li>Add niter kibbeh and garlic, then stir in the berbere spice mix and tomato paste. Cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces and coat them well in the spice mixture.</li>
        <li>Add enough water to cover the chicken, then simmer on low heat for about 30-40 minutes, stirring
            occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add boiled eggs (if using) and season with salt. Simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>
